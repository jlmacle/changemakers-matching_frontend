To take into account in the development:

* Pro Spring Security, 3rd edition, Massimo Nardone, Carlo Scarioni
"Applications should run as isolated as possible from the other components of the host machine.", p.5

* The Web application hacker's handbook, 2nd edition, Daffyd Stuttard, Marcus Pinto
"Users can interfere with any piece of data transmitted between the client and the server,
including request parameters, cookies and HTTP headers.", p.9

"Any assumption developers make about users will interact with the application 
may be violated.", p.9

"Approaches based on data sanitization are often highly effective (...)"

"Some people's names contain an apostrophy or hyphen. These could be used in attacks against databases 
(...)", p.24
➡️ in case of addresses in user inputs

"To prevent SQL injection attacks, 
any characters within the user input that may be used to attack the database 
are escaped before the query is constructed.", p.27

"To prevent SOAP injection attacks,
any XML metacharacters within the user's profile 
are suitably encoded.", p.27

"To prevent cross-site scripting attacks,
the application HTML-encodes any user-supplied data 
that is embedded in the returned page.", p.27
